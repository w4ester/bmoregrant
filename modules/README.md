# Baltimore AI Producers Lab - Workshop Modules

## Overview

This directory contains the complete curriculum for the 7-module Baltimore AI Producers Lab program. Each module is designed for family-based learning (ages 14-55) with a focus on building AI tools, not just using them.

## Program Philosophy

**Producer Mindset:** Families learn to BUILD AI tools from pre-trained models, creating a producer-first, consumer-second relationship with technology.

**Family Learning:** Multi-generational workshops where youth (14-17), young adults (18-25), and adults (26-55) learn together, creating sustainable household culture change.

**Local Models:** Everything runs on-premises (NVIDIA DGX Spark + Mac Studios), with zero ongoing subscription costs. Families own their tools forever.
